# American-Sign-Language-Detector-Using-CNN
Creating a Convolutionanl Neural Network using PyTorch to classify American Sign Language gestures with their appropriate letters. This is also an end to end implementation, that begins with loading and processing an image dataset with PyTorch's DataLoader and dataset classes. We also try out several different CNN models, and experiment with techniques such as batch normalization, difference between cross entropy loss and MSE loss, and so on. The dataset for this project was created manually and hence it only consists of the letter from A to K (not including J because it requires motion to sign). However, upon gathering more data, these models are easily extendable.
